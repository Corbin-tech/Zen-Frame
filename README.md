Zen Frame is a web application built with the Astro framework and using components from Alpine. It is a simple time blocking and to do list manager that tries to be minimalistic or "zen" by design. Everyone has different things going on in their lives and cannot always be hyper productive like we sometimes see on social media. For example, Seeing all of your tasks at once can be stressful and hard to keep track of. Zen Frame helps you get started by displaying your tasks one at a time and lets you rescheule as you go because sometimes you just need to take a break. This is the goal of Zen Frame, to be as flexible and simple as possible for YOU.
